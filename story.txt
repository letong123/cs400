Start:
  Long time ago there was a powerful kingdom. One day a dragon came to the kingdom and seized the princess. 
The king was very angry, so he tried to recruit a strong army to defeat the evil dragon and promised to 
gave the person that defeat the dragon anything he wanted. At this time, a brave farmer heard this news. He
came to the palace to join in the army, but he found there were only nine people in the army
because other people were too afraid of the dragon. Then, the journey of this team began.
Middle:
  The team started their long trek to the dragon's lair. Along the journey the farmer started to realize that
  many of the team members seemed to have no interest in working together to slay the dragon. The farmer
  pleaded with them as the journey progressed to make a plan as a team to give them a chance against the dragon.
  A few other members started to make a plan with the farmer, but most of the members had no interest in the
  farmers plan. At this time, the group spotted the dragon's lair in the distance and realized they were about
  to reach their destination.
End:
  Upon reaching the dragon's lair, five of the army members decided that they were not going to help slay the dragon.
  The farmer fought back his tears as he watched them leave - he was terrified but didn't want to look weak in front
  of the others. The team had spent so much time arguing about whether or not they should do anything, they didn't hatch
  a scheme at all. Before they could, the dragon flew towards them and dropped a comically tiny paper by their feet.
  The farmer picked it up and read it aloud: "She's safe - I only borrowed her because I'm need help redecorating my 
  room; I'll drop her off tomorrow."
